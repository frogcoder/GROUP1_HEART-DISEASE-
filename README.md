# Heart Disease Classification Project

This project implements various machine learning classification approaches to predict heart disease using a heart disease dataset.

## Project Overview

The project implements and compares five different classification approaches:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Key Features

- Dataset preprocessing and cleaning
- Implementation of multiple classification algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Feature importance analysis and feature selection experiments
- Model performance comparison and evaluation

## Project Structure

- `heart.csv`: The dataset used for analysis
- `EDA_Data_preeprocessing.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all analysis and model implementations
- `pyproject.toml`: Project dependencies and configuration

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required packages are listed in pyproject.toml

## Analysis Steps

1. Dataset description and feature explanation
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning
3. Model implementation and training
4. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
5. Feature selection analysis and model re-evaluation
